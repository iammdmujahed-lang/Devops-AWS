Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size. If you specify the desired capacity, either when you create the group or at any time thereafter, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group has this many instances. If you specify scaling policies, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases.

For example, the following Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group has a minimum size of four instances, a desired capacity of six instances, and a maximum size of twelve instances. The scaling policies that you define adjust the number of instances, within your minimum and maximum number of instances, based on the criteria that you specify.

Features of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, your EC2 instances are organized into Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups so that they can be treated as a logical unit for the purposes of scaling and management. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups use launch templates (or launch configurations) as configuration templates for their EC2 instances.

The following are key features of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:

Monitoring the health of running instances
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically monitors the health and availability of your instances using EC2 health checks and replaces terminated or impaired instances to maintain your desired capacity.

Custom health checks
In addition to the built-in health checks, you can define custom health checks that are specific to your application to verify that it's responding as expected. If an instance fails your custom health check, it's automatically replaced to maintain your desired capacity.

Balancing capacity across Availability Zones
You can specify multiple Availability Zones for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances your instances evenly across the Availability Zones as the group scales. This provides high availability and resiliency by protecting your applications from failures in a single location.

Multiple instance types and purchase options
Within a single Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, you can launch multiple instance types and purchase options (Spot and On-Demand Instances), allowing you to optimize costs through Spot Instance usage. You can also take advantage of Reserved Instance and Savings Plans discounts by using them in conjunction with On-Demand Instances in the group.

Automated replacement of Spot Instances
If your group includes Spot Instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can automatically request replacement Spot capacity if your Spot Instances are interrupted. Through Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can also monitor and proactively replace your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of interruption.

Load balancing
You can use ELB load balancing and health checks to ensure an even distribution of application traffic to your healthy instances. Whenever instances are launched or terminated, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically registers and deregisters the instances from the load balancer.

Scalability
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also provides several ways for you to scale your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. Using auto scaling allows you to maintain application availability and reduce costs by adding capacity to handle peak loads and removing capacity when demand is lower. You can also manually adjust the size of your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group as needed.

Instance refresh
The instance refresh feature provides a mechanism to update instances in a rolling fashion when you update your AMI or launch template. You can also use a phased approach, known as a canary deployment, to test a new AMI or launch template on a small set of instances before rolling it out to the whole group.
